Docker

Installing Docker
==================
.. image:: ../../images/ac.png
   :alt: Miniconda
   :target: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
   :class: with-shadow
   :scale: 30

First, you should download Miniconda (links to the various miniconda versions on the Miniconda website: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

.. Note:: If you wish to use Python on the Archer2's compute nodes then you must install Miniconda in your /work directories as these are the only ones visible on the compute nodes.


Once you have downloaded the installer, you can run it. 
For example:

    .. code-block:: console
		
		user@login*:~> bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
